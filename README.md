# Pymaceuticals Data Using Matplotlib

## Objective 

To import csv files for clinical trail and mouse drug data to process and plot in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Purpose/Goal

From the imported data use Pandas to clean and merge the two csv files.  From the merge data manipulate the data to plot using Matplotlib for correlations tumor response, metastatic site response, survival during treatment, and mean tumor change.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Modules Used

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Plots for Graphs
